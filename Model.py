# Hardcode lots of different parameters. If there is no value for a parameter, let it equal 0.
# Depending on what parameters we have, depends on what method we will call in order to calculate the necessary calculation. 
# This means that the code can function fine without having to have to change the calculation if we don't have certain parameters.
